"""Automatic (inline) plasticity hooks — the 'synaptic' mechanism.

Every time an agent uses a skill, retrieves memory, or completes/fails, a
small hook in this module fires and updates the plasticity substrate
immediately:

    on_skill_outcome(conn, skill_id, agent_id, success)
        → upserts skill↔skill associations for siblings already used in
          the same agent session, decays them lazily on read.

    on_memory_hits(conn, memory_ids, requesting_agent_id)
        → upserts memory↔memory associations for co-retrieved entries,
          plus skill↔memory edges for any skills the agent has used.

    on_agent_completion(conn, agent_id, status)
        → extracts failure fingerprints from errored tool_calls when the
          agent failed, upserts the episode_signals row, and — once every
          ``episode_threshold`` completions — enqueues a threshold-
          triggered consolidation pass (lazy, runs in the same process).

This is deliberately Hebbian: 'entities that fire in the same agent session
wire together'. An `agent_id` defines the session boundary, which matches
KAOS's existing isolation model perfectly.

All hooks are best-effort: they swallow OperationalError so pre-v5 databases
keep working even if something else tries to use these code paths. Fast
(sub-millisecond per call) so hooking them into the hot path is cheap.
