# Changelog

All notable changes to KAOS are documented here.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-05-13

### Finer-grained outcomes, failures, objectives — and a war-room UI

One point release, one additive schema migration (v7 → v8), no breaking changes. Four tracks folded into a single release.

**Track A — continuous quality score [0,1]**
- `record_outcome(quality=...)` — partial credit instead of a binary coin flip; `ValueError` outside `[0,1]` (never silently clamped)
- Plasticity ranker uses `SUM(quality)` for graded rows, binary path byte-for-byte unchanged when absent
- CLI `kaos skills outcome <id> --quality Q`; MCP `skill_outcome` gains `quality`
- **Measured +4.0pp accuracy** (85.3% → 89.3%, 5 seeds). The variance-reduction hypothesis was measured and did **not** hold — reported, not hidden.

**Track B1 — reasoning-class failure taxonomy** (arXiv:2509.25370)
- `taxonomy_class` (memory/reflection/planning/action/system) orthogonal to the execution `category`; LLM diagnoser emits + caches it
- CLI `kaos dream failures --taxonomy-class planning`

**Track B2 — critical-step localizer**
- Reconstructs the agent timeline and points at the *earliest decisive* step, not the visible error; heuristic-first, LLM cached by trajectory shape
- CLI `kaos dream localize <agent>`; MCP `dream_localize`
- **Measured 5/5** planted bugs localized within ±1 step

**Track B3 — Ideal State Artifacts (ISA/ISC)** (PAI pattern)
- Declare "what done looks like" as verifiable criteria; per-criterion pass/fail is a finer plasticity signal than one binary task outcome
- CLI `kaos ideal-state create|mark|show|list`; MCP `ideal_state_create|mark|get`
- Composition: ISA quality → Track A graded outcome; failed ISCs group by Track B1 taxonomy; a failing ISC links to Track B2's localized step

**Track C — Aegean incremental quorum: gated out**
- Forward-compat columns ship; decide-side code intentionally unbuilt per the documented gating rule. Honest no-op, not a shortcut.

**Track D — war-room UI refresh** (Naroh091/hermes-war-room IA, MIT)
- No stack change — vanilla single static HTML + the existing server. Split layout (mission control ‖ operatives floor), colored agent discs, click-to-dossier, LogAct intent kanban, opt-in light theme (dark default)
- Additive endpoints only; the original dashboard left intact

### Stats

- **550 unit tests** (+85 from 0.8.2; 0 regressions)
- MCP surface **46 → 50 tools**
- 2 new benchmarks (`demo_quality_score_bench/`, `demo_critical_step_bench/`); every prior benchmark re-run with unchanged shape
- Schema v7 → v8 single additive migration; fresh + v7→v8 upgrade both tested

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-24

### Addressing Whitepaper §6 Limitations Using KAOS Itself

v0.8.2 closes the gaps identified in the v0.8.1 whitepaper's Limitations section. Every item is tackled with real code, real tests, and real measured numbers — no shortcuts, no hardcoding.

**Policy consumer loop closed (§6.3a)**
- `SharedLog.intent_auto(agent_id, action)` matches the intent against the `policies` table; enabled + promoted policies auto-approve by appending a synthetic vote + decision and bumping `applied_count` / `last_applied_at`
- Safe on pre-schema-v5 databases (gracefully falls through to standard `intent()`)
- `intent()` itself is unchanged

**Merge workflow loop closed (§6.3b)**
- `list_pending_merges()`, `accept_merge(proposal_id, keep_skill_id=...)`, `reject_merge(proposal_id, reason=...)` in `kaos/dream/phases/consolidation.py`
- Accept migrates `skill_uses` telemetry, collapses associations (weight-merging on conflict, self-edges pruned), rolls counters into the keeper, soft-deprecates the retired skill with a merge rationale
- CLI: `kaos dream merges [--accept N | --reject N --reason "..." | --keep K]`
- MCP: `dream_merges` tool (MCP surface 45 → **46 tools**)

**LLM-backed diagnoser with fingerprint cache (§6.4)**
- `LLMDiagnoser(call_fn, conn, model)` in `kaos/dream/diagnosis.py`
- Cache-first: `llm_diagnosis_cache` keyed by error fingerprint; each unique failure pays the LLM cost at most once
- Heuristic-primary: `diagnose(..., llm_fallback=d)` only calls the LLM when every heuristic returns `None`
- Provider-agnostic: takes a `Callable[[str], str]` — works with any model (Anthropic SDK, raw httpx vLLM, mock)
- Robust JSON parsing handles prose-prefixed, markdown-fenced, and ill-formed responses; graceful degradation when the callback raises

**Three new benchmarks with real measured numbers (§6.1)**
- `demo_realistic_retrieval_bench/` — non-adversarial library (40 realistic engineering skills, natural-language queries, deployment-specific ground truth). **BM25 73.3% → weighted 86.7% (+13.3 pp, +18.2%)**
- `demo_alpha_sweep_bench/` — sensitivity sweep over the plasticity weight `usage_multiplier ∈ {0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12}`. Default α=3.0 sits on a **broad plateau at 93.3% covering α = 2–12** — not a knife-edge choice
- `demo_consolidation_scale_bench/` — wall-clock cost at 100 / 1k / 10k skills: **108 ms / 493 ms / 38.1 s**. Sub-linear below 1k; near-quadratic above (Jaccard merge scan). Documented trade-off with mitigation (shard by tag or disable merge detection at very-large scale)

**Schema v6 → v7 (additive)**
- `consolidation_proposals.status` column (`pending` / `applied` / `rejected` / `superseded`) with index; existing `applied=1` rows backfill to `'applied'`
- New `llm_diagnosis_cache` table (fingerprint-keyed, with model attribution)

### Tests

**465 unit tests passing** (+42 from 0.8.1; 0 regressions)
- `tests/test_policy_consumer.py` — 7 tests
- `tests/test_merge_workflow.py` — 18 tests
- `tests/test_llm_diagnoser.py` — 17 tests

### Honest limits that remain

- §6.1 is *partially* resolved: three new realistic benchmarks land with real numbers, but the ARC-AGI-3 scenario is still a simulation of a live meta-harness run, not a live execution
- §6.2 (biological metaphor) and §6.5 (platform dependence of absolute timings) are **unchanged** — the explicit "architectural analogy, not neurobiological claim" disclaimer and the policy of reporting *deltas* rather than raw latencies are the honest framing, not gaps to close

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-24

### Neuroplasticity: The Library Rewires Itself

KAOS v0.8.1 turns the agent library from a passive filing cabinet into a
self-organizing graph. Inline synaptic plasticity plus batched structural
consolidation, modeled after biological sleep-consolidation separation.

**Inline plasticity hooks (synaptic)**
- Every `SkillStore.record_outcome(...)` writes a `skill_uses` row in the caller's existing transaction — zero extra fsync
- Every `MemoryStore.search(record_hits=True)` writes `memory_hits` rows
- Every `Kaos.complete/fail/kill(agent_id)` triggers inline `episode_signals` upsert (single agent, indexed; not a full replay)
- Opt-out: `KAOS_DREAM_AUTO=0` disables all hooks

**Batched structural consolidation (sleep)**
- At agent completion: one `executemany` rebuilds the Hebbian co-occurrence graph for the session (skill↔skill, memory↔memory, skill↔memory edges)
- At every `KAOS_DREAM_THRESHOLD` (default 100) completions: full consolidation pass proposes promote (memory → skill), prune (low-success skill → soft-deprecate), and merge (near-duplicate) changes
- Proposals journalled to `consolidation_proposals`; safe actions auto-applied, merges stay human-review

**Weighted retrieval**
- New `rank="weighted"` on `SkillStore.search()` and `MemoryStore.search()`: composite score of BM25 × Wilson-lower-bound success × exponential recency decay
- Default remains BM25; weighted is opt-in per call
- CLI exposes `--rank weighted` on `kaos skills search` and `kaos memory search`

**Failure intelligence**
- 8 built-in heuristic diagnosers categorise errors into `transient` / `config` / `code` / `infra` / `unknown` with root cause and suggested action — pure Python, no LLM calls
- Fix-outcome tracking: a "known fix" that fails 5+ times with <50% success rate auto-downgrades so future agents stop applying broken suggestions
- Systemic alerts: ≥N agents hitting the same fingerprint inside a sliding window raises a `systemic_alerts` row; consumers should refuse to spawn until resolved
- Pluggable `Diagnoser` protocol for custom rules; `register_diagnoser()` prepends to the registry

**Schema v6 (additive; v3 DBs migrate in place)**
- New tables: `skill_uses`, `memory_hits`, `episode_signals`, `dream_runs`, `associations`, `failure_fingerprints`, `failure_occurrences`, `systemic_alerts`, `consolidation_proposals`, `policies`
- New columns: `agent_skills.deprecated`, `agent_skills.deprecated_at`, `agent_skills.deprecated_reason`

**10 new CLI commands under `kaos dream`**
- `kaos dream run [--dry-run|--apply]` — manual full cycle (7 phases)
- `kaos dream runs` — list past runs
- `kaos dream show <run_id>` — reprint a digest
- `kaos dream related <skill|memory> <name>` — Hebbian lookup
- `kaos dream consolidate [--dry-run|--apply]` — structural changes
- `kaos dream failures [--min-count N]` — recurring fingerprints with category
- `kaos dream diagnose <fp_id> [--category ...]` — show or set diagnosis
- `kaos dream fix-outcome <fp_id> --succeeded|--failed` — fix-outcome tracking
- `kaos dream systemic [--ack N|--resolve N]` — incident lifecycle

**8 new MCP tools**
`dream_run`, `dream_related`, `dream_consolidate`, `failure_lookup`, `failure_list`, `failure_diagnose`, `failure_fix_outcome`, `systemic_alerts`. Total MCP surface now **45 tools**.

### Architecture rewrite (measured)

The initial M2 design fired inline association upserts on every `record_outcome`. A committed microbenchmark measured **+210 ms p50 overhead** and rejected the build pre-merge. Rewrote graph construction from per-event to batched-at-completion (single `executemany` per session). Final measured overhead: **+15 µs p50** on `record_outcome`, **+872 µs p50** on `agent_complete`. **14,000× faster.**

### Measured gains

All three numbers below come from benchmarks committed in the repo alongside their data and scripts — reproducible with `uv run python demo_*/run.py` or `/scenario.py`:

- **Retrieval accuracy**: BM25 80% → plasticity-weighted 90% (+10 pp, +12.5%). Seed=42 reproducible. Source: `demo_neuroplasticity_bench/`
- **Hot-path overhead**: +15 µs p50 record_outcome, +872 µs p50 agent_complete, p99 within budget. Source: `demo_plasticity_overhead_bench/`
- **Failure triage**: 60/60 validations pass — 7 planted error types correctly categorised, fix auto-downgrade after 5 failed attempts, systemic alert on 4-agent wave. Source: `demo_failure_intelligence_bench/`

### Documentation

- [Blog post (growth story with charts)](blog/kaos-neuroplasticity.html) — 7 chapters, 4 inline SVG charts, embedded demo GIF
- [Whitepaper](papers/kaos-neuroplasticity-whitepaper.html) — 16 pages, formal paper structure, simulated adversarial review from 3 reviewer personas (systems, info retrieval, cognitive science) with author responses
- [docs/neuroplasticity.md](https://github.com/canivel/kaos/blob/main/docs/neuroplasticity.md) — full mechanism reference with schema and formulas

### Honest limits
- Gains are workload-conditional: requires outcome feedback and retrieval ambiguity
- `policies` table populates but is not yet consulted (M4 scaffolding)
- Merge detection uses Jaccard-on-word-bags; catches obvious duplicates, misses semantic ones; never auto-applied
- Heuristic diagnosers cover common cases; exotic errors stay `unknown` until a custom diagnoser is registered

### Stats
- 423 unit tests passing (+30 from 0.8.0; 0 regressions)
- 181 total scenario validations (45 dream use case + 60 failure intelligence + 76 ARC-AGI-3)
- 3 new benchmark folders committed next to the code

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-09

### CORAL: Autonomous Multi-Agent Evolution (inspired by arXiv:2604.01658)

Three tiers of CORAL-inspired improvements to the Meta-Harness.

**Tier 1 — Stagnation Detection + Pivot Prompts**
- `SearchConfig.stagnation_threshold` (default 3): after N consecutive non-improving iterations, inject a `PIVOT REQUIRED` section into the proposer digest requiring a structurally different approach
- `SearchConfig.consolidation_interval` (default 5): skills heartbeat fires every K iterations
- `stagnant_iterations` and `delta` returned in `mh_next_iteration` response so Claude Code can observe the stagnation signal
- Both automated (`search.py`) and collaborative (`mh_next_iteration`) paths track stagnation

**Tier 2 — Three-Tier Memory (attempts / notes / skills)**
- Search archive gains `/attempts/`, `/notes/`, `/skills/` directories (CORAL filesystem model)
- Every evaluated harness writes a compact summary to `/attempts/{id}.json` — fast scanning without reading full source
- `mh_submit_candidate` accepts optional `notes` param — observations written to `/notes/iter_N.md`
- New MCP tool `mh_write_skill(search_agent_id, name, description, code_template)` — write reusable patterns discovered during search; persisted to knowledge agent across searches
- Skills loaded into every proposer prompt and `mh_next_iteration` digest (max 10, MRU)
- Consolidation heartbeat in digest asks proposer to extract skills every `consolidation_interval` iterations
- Skills survive across searches: `_file_to_knowledge` now archives `/skills/` alongside harnesses

**Tier 3 — Concurrent Multi-Agent Co-Evolution**
- New MCP tool `mh_spawn_coevolution(benchmark, n_agents, ...)` — spawns N independent search agents + 1 hub agent
- New MCP tool `mh_hub_sync(search_agent_id)` — push current best harnesses+skills to hub, pull other agents' discoveries into local archive
- Auto-sync: `mh_next_iteration` calls `_do_hub_sync` automatically every `hub_sync_interval` iterations (default 2)
- Hub structure: `/best_per_agent/agent_N/`, `/shared_skills/`, `/shared_attempts/`
- Cross-agent harnesses appear in next digest and Pareto frontier

### Demo Use Cases

Six end-to-end demonstrations published alongside v0.6.0:

- **[SDLC Self-Healing](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-sdlc-self-healing.html)** — Payment service wrong-fix detected, checkpoint restore in 0.3s, root cause from audit trail, correct fix applied without human intervention
- **[Security Audit Swarm](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-security-swarm.html)** — 4 parallel isolated agents audit a PR (SQLi, secrets, auth, deserialization); findings aggregated via SQL query across VFS
- **[DB Migration Rollback](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-migration-rollback.html)** — 2M-row backfill hits anomaly at row 847,412; surgical per-agent restore in 0.3s; analytics agents untouched
- **[Incident Response](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-incident-response.html)** — 23% HTTP 500 rate; event journal query finds 847 ConnectionPoolErrors; root cause traced to config change 47 min prior; post-mortem auto-written
- **[ML Research Lab](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-ml-research-lab.html)** — 4 parallel hypothesis agents (LoRA, Lion, batch scaling, dropout); winner val_loss=1.89 (-19.2% vs baseline); inspired by Karpathy autoresearch
- **[Regression Guard](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-regression-guard.html)** — Model swap drops code_review 0.83→0.76; CI gate blocks deploy; 5-iteration Meta-Harness repair restores 0.83 automatically

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-07

### ARC-AGI-3 Benchmark + Search Hang Fix

- **ARC-AGI-3 benchmark** (`kaos/metaharness/benchmarks/arc_agi3.py`) — new interactive game benchmark. Scoring via RHAE (Relative Human Action Efficiency). Harnesses define `run(problem)` + `choose_action(grid, available_actions, state)`. 4 seed strategies: random, systematic, productive-first, click-objects.
- **Fix: search hanging** — root cause: `asyncio.wait_for` cannot cancel `run_in_executor` threads. With old defaults (10 games × 120s × 4 seeds = 80 min) the process appeared frozen. Fixed: `time_per_game=25s`, `max_actions=800`, `n_search_games=6`. Seed eval now takes ~1.5 min (eval_subset=1) or ~3 min (eval_subset=2).
- **MCP stdio guard** — `arc_agi.Arcade()` adds a `logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)` on init, which corrupts the MCP transport. Monkeypatches `StreamHandler.__init__` to redirect any stdout handler to stderr before import.
- **`SearchConfig.harness_timeout_seconds` 300 → 60** — per-problem cap; arc-agi-3 games run at most 25s, all other benchmarks complete in seconds.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-07

### AAAK Compact Notation + Tiered Loading (inspired by MemPalace)

- **AAAK-style compact notation** -- replaces verbose markdown with dense shorthand: `H:keyword|i2|acc=1.0|cost=8.0|8/8✓`. All LLMs read it without decoders. 57% savings at default level (was 34%).
- **Tiered loading** -- L0 (verbose), L1 (AAAK+source), L2 (AAAK+top-3 source), L3 (ultra-compact scores only). Maps to compaction levels 0-10.
- **100% quality at default** across all 5 domains (classification, code gen, research, tool calling, ML) with 49-72% savings per domain.
- **L3 ultra** achieves 95% savings for severely context-limited scenarios.

### Comparison: Old vs AAAK

```
Before (structured extraction):  34% saved, 100% quality at default
After  (AAAK + tiered loading):  57% saved, 100% quality at default  ← +68% more savings
```

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-07

### Surrogate Verifier (EvoSkills paper, arXiv:2604.01687)

- **#31 Surrogate Verifier** -- After evaluating a harness, a separate verifier analyzes the results and produces structured failure diagnostics: per-problem root-cause analysis, failure pattern grouping, and actionable revision suggestions.
- Informationally isolated: verifier reads outputs, NOT harness source code (prevents confirmation bias).
- Integrated into evaluator: every `EvaluationResult` now carries a `diagnosis` with failure patterns, root causes, and suggestions.
- Integrated into compactor: digest includes verifier suggestions and root causes alongside scores/traces.
- Integrated into `mh_next_iteration`: response includes verifier diagnosis text so the proposer (Claude Code) sees structured "why it failed" + "how to fix it" alongside the archive digest.
- MCP stdio fix: `sys.stdout = sys.stderr` was eating MCP protocol responses. Now preserves original stdout for the MCP transport.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-06

### Collaborative Meta-Harness — Claude Code IS the proposer

Three new MCP tools that let Claude Code drive the search loop directly. No subprocess, no API key, no extra cost — inference happens in your current session.

- **`mh_start_search`** — evaluates seeds, returns archive digest. YOU read it and write a better harness.
- **`mh_submit_candidate`** — submit your harness code for evaluation.
- **`mh_next_iteration`** — evaluates pending candidates, updates frontier, returns updated digest.

The loop: `mh_start_search` → read digest → write harness → `mh_submit_candidate` → `mh_next_iteration` → read updated digest → repeat.

Why this works: the CLI subprocess bottleneck (354s for 60K chars) is eliminated entirely. Claude Code already has an active API connection — no subprocess, no process startup, no stdin/stdout serialization. The digest goes into the conversation context and the response comes back as part of the normal tool flow.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-06

### New Provider: Claude Agent SDK

- **`provider: agent_sdk`** -- 5th provider type. Uses `claude_agent_sdk.query()` instead of `claude --print` subprocess. No rate limit competition with active Claude Code sessions. Seeds scored 90.6% accuracy vs 0% with `claude_code` provider in the same session.
- **Single-shot proposer** -- proposer makes one LLM call instead of 5-10 multi-turn tool calls. Completes in ~18s vs timing out at 120s+.
- **Empty response = error** -- `claude --print` returning empty stdout now retries 3x with backoff then raises with actionable message instead of silently producing garbage.
- Default timeout 600s → 300s across all providers (120s was too short for complex benchmarks).
- `max_prior_seeds=5` — caps knowledge compounding to top 5 discoveries instead of loading all.

### Provider Comparison

- `agent_sdk` -- shares session auth, no subprocess, works during active sessions
- `claude_code` -- `claude --print` subprocess, only works when session is idle
- `anthropic` -- direct API via httpx, needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, independent quota
- `openai` -- any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, needs API key
- `local` -- vLLM/ollama/llama.cpp, zero cost, needs GPU

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-06

### Bug Fixes

- **#27 Proposer text extraction fallback** -- `claude --print` doesn't support tool-use, so the proposer couldn't call `mh_submit_harness`. Now extracts ```python blocks from plain text responses as a fallback. Works with any provider.

### Compaction Eval

- Expanded to 5 domains: classification (52% saved), code generation (31%), research/RAG (28%), tool calling (30%), ML training (28%)
- 100% quality retained at default level across all domains
- Aggregate: 34% savings at default, 88% quality at max

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-06

### Knowledge Compounding (Karpathy LLM Wiki pattern)

- **#22 Cross-search memory** -- Persistent "kaos-knowledge" agent stores winning harnesses and frontiers. New searches automatically load prior discoveries as seeds instead of starting from scratch. Knowledge compounds across searches.
- **#23 VFS auto-index** -- `kaos index <agent-id>` builds `/index.md` with categorized file listing. `Kaos.build_index()` API.
- **#24 Lint operation** -- `kaos mh lint <search-agent-id>` health-checks for empty scores, failed harnesses, iteration errors, missing frontiers.
- **#26 Persistent skills** -- Winning harnesses auto-filed to knowledge agent. `kaos mh knowledge` shows discoveries by benchmark. Future searches use prior winners as seeds.

### Smart Context Compaction (#11 partial fix)

- **Compactor class** -- Tunable compaction (level 0-10) with three strategies: lossless (scores, source), structured extraction (traces → error patterns + samples), progressive summarization (conversation → sliding window).
- **Archive digest** -- Proposer gets a pre-built digest of all harnesses instead of doing 5-10 tool calls. Reduces proposer turns from ~10 to 1-2, fixing the main cause of `claude --print` timeouts.
- **Conversation compaction** -- CCR auto-compacts conversations >20 messages. Old tool results compressed to `[tool result: N chars]`. Recent messages kept verbatim.
- **compaction_level config** -- `SearchConfig.compaction_level` (0-10), configurable in `kaos.yaml`. Level 0 = raw data, 5 = balanced (default), 10 = maximum.
- **38 compaction tests** -- Monotonic compression verified across all levels. Retention score measured (scores + source always preserved). Digest quality validated at 7 levels.

### Full-Text Search (Hermes Agent pattern)

- **#25 VFS search** -- `kaos search "query"` searches across all file contents. `--agent` scopes to one agent. `Kaos.search()` API. Returns agent_id, path, line number, matching content.

### New CLI Commands

- `kaos search <query>` -- full-text search across all agent VFS contents
- `kaos index <agent-id>` -- build /index.md for an agent's VFS
- `kaos mh lint <search-id>` -- health-check a search archive
- `kaos mh knowledge` -- view persistent knowledge base / discoveries

### New Core API

- `Kaos.get_or_create_singleton(name)` -- get or create a persistent named agent
- `Kaos.build_index(agent_id)` -- build /index.md for an agent
- `Kaos.search(query, agent_id=None)` -- full-text search across file contents

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes

- **#1 CLI Unicode crash on Windows** -- `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")` at CLI startup prevents `UnicodeEncodeError` with cp1252 console encoding.
- **#2 MCP parallel spawn WAL contention** -- `spawn()` retries up to 3 times on `OperationalError: database locked` with backoff. `PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint=100` keeps WAL file small.
- **#7 MCP result truncation for large outputs** -- Results >4KB are written to agent VFS at `/result.txt`. MCP returns a preview + pointer to full result via `agent_read`.
- **#16 Background search write lock** -- `wal_autocheckpoint=100` ensures frequent WAL checkpointing, reducing lock hold time for concurrent access.

### New CLI Commands

- **`kaos read <agent_id> <path>`** (#4) -- Read files from an agent's virtual filesystem directly from the CLI. Supports `--json`.
- **`kaos logs <agent_id>`** (#6) -- View an agent's conversation history and event log. `--tail N` for last N events. Supports `--json`.

### Other

- **#3 Agent timeout** -- Already fixed in v0.3.0 (600s default, configurable via `kaos.yaml`). Closed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-04

### CLI-First Architecture

- **`--json` flag on all CLI commands** -- Global `--json` flag (auto-enabled when piped) adds structured JSON output to every command: `ls`, `status`, `query`, `kill`, `checkpoint`, `checkpoints`, `mh search`, `mh frontier`, `mh status`. Errors output as `{"error": "..."}`. Makes KAOS composable with any agent framework via shell -- no MCP required.

- **Worker subprocess for `mh search`** -- New `kaos/metaharness/worker.py` runs the Meta-Harness search as a detached background process. If the parent CLI or MCP server dies, the search continues. Launch with `kaos mh search --background` or via the MCP `mh_search` tool (which now always spawns a worker).

- **`provider: claude_code`** -- New provider type that shells out to `claude --print` using Claude Code's subscription auth. No API key needed. Handles Windows `.CMD` wrapper parsing, `CLAUDECODE` env var stripping, nvm path resolution, and thread-executor subprocess for MCP compatibility.

### Reliability Fixes

- **Fail-fast retries** -- `max_retries` default changed from 3 to 1. With `ClaudeCodeProvider`, each retry is a 600s subprocess -- retries are now handled at the search loop level, not the provider level.

- **Proposer timeout + error handling** -- `proposer.propose()` wrapped with `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=900s)` and try/except. Failed iterations are logged to `/iterations/{N}/error.json` and skipped instead of crashing the search.

- **SQLite DB locking fix** -- `busy_timeout` raised from 5s to 30s. `kill()` falls back to `_force_kill()` with a fresh connection on `OperationalError: database is locked`. Prevents stuck agents when multiple processes share `kaos.db`.

- **Evaluator bug fixes** -- `_truncate()` no longer creates invalid JSON on large results. Error/timeout score keys stripped of `+`/`-` prefixes to match success score keys.

- **Usage field mismatch fix** -- `GEPARouter._parse_response()` handles both `VLLMClient` (`prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens`) and `LLMProvider` (`input_tokens`/`output_tokens`) field names.

### Configuration

- **`ModelConfig.timeout`** -- Per-model timeout (default 600s), configurable in `kaos.yaml` and wired through `GEPARouter` to `ClaudeCodeProvider`.
- **`SearchConfig.proposer_timeout_seconds`** -- Per-iteration proposer timeout (default 900s).
- **MCP `mh_frontier` enriched** -- Now returns agent status, current iteration, and harnesses evaluated count alongside the frontier data.

### Upgrade Guide

```bash
git pull origin main
uv sync
kaos --version  # should show 0.3.1
```

If you have the MCP server running, restart it so it picks up the new code. Claude Code restarts the MCP server automatically when you start a new session. Any running background workers will continue on the old version until they finish.

If upgrading from v0.1.0/v0.2.0:
- Existing `kaos.yaml` configs and `kaos.db` databases work unchanged across versions.
- New `provider: claude_code` option available -- run `kaos setup` to reconfigure.
- CLI commands now output JSON when piped. Use `--json` flag explicitly in scripts.
- `kaos mh search --background` is the recommended way to run searches.
- New commands: `kaos read`, `kaos logs`, `kaos mh search --dry-run`.
