"""PR-4 (v0.9) — action-realization probe regression tests.

These tests don't try to reproduce the binding verdict (that requires
organic data and is captured in demo_action_realization_bench/VERDICT.md).
They guard against goalpost moves and harness drift:

  * the lock sha256 is the one pre-registered before any probe code
    existed (any future edit to ISA.lock.json must update KNOWN_LOCK_SHA256
    AND change this test);
  * the falsification self-test stays ADMISSIBLE — FULL := B1 emits
    [KILL: G1];
  * the workload sampler honours synthetic_fallback=NONE: with an empty
    DB it returns insufficient counts and is_sufficient flags VOID#1.
